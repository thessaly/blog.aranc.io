I"a<p>So, welcome to my blog! It’s called <em>hyphae</em>. Which is the plural of <em>hypha</em>, and according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha">Wikipedia</a> is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a long, branching filamentous structure of a fungus, oomycete, or actinobacterium.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>in most fungi are the main mode of vegetative growth, and are collectively called a mycelium.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Besides thinking fungi look extremely cool (see below), I like the fact that hyphae grow at their tips, kind of building on top of whatever is already there, elongating further.</p>

<p>Moreover, the symbiotic association of fungi with some tress/plants, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a> it’s something that blew my mind when I learned about it during <a href="https://www.agro.uba.ar/carreras/ambientales">undergrad</a>. It allows not only the exchange of sugar compounds (or food for fungi) in return for minerals that plants need; it’s also a whole communications network<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Trees use it to signal stress to their neighbours<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, including alerts if a predator is nearby (so they can prepare their defenses)<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, and of course for transferring resources between them.</p>

<p><em>Those are enough reasons for hyphae to deserve -at least- a blog.</em></p>

<p> </p>
<h3 id="what-to-expect-from-this-blog">What to expect from this blog</h3>
<p>I expect this blog will have almost none (in the best case, very little) of plant phisiology content, sorry for that.</p>

<p>Hyphae will host some of the things I’m doing <em>on the sides</em> of my life as a PhD-student-who-also-has-many-side-projects. These are probably the things I enjoy the most, and keep me surviving through <a href="github.com/thessaly/phd">the thesis</a> process.</p>

<p>Some topics that may appear as I learn along the way:</p>

<ul>
  <li>open hardware, some small experiments and also some reflections,</li>
  <li>wikidata &amp; python experiments,</li>
  <li>ideas on feminism, particularly in the “open” technology spaces,</li>
  <li>ideas on community organizing, cooperativism and changing the world,</li>
  <li>ideas on agroecological ways of producing food (related to item above),</li>
  <li>posts in English and Spanish (as much as I can)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is, of course, an ever-growing list.</p>

<p>Just like hyphae, these are work and ideas which grow at the tips, slowly, elongating a bit each time. They’re also exchanging material and information (in my head and now here), and at some point I expect them to connect to each other.</p>
