I"•<p>I find narrating stories both necessary and delightful. I enjoy the exercise of tracing threads back, crafting a path for the reader, (partially) understanding how and why things got to a certain point in time. Besides, there‚Äôs lot of power in putting the past into words; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_revisionism">historical revisionism</a> wouldn‚Äôt exist all along history otherwise.</p>

<p>In particular if you‚Äôre doing a PhD in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_studies">Science &amp; Technology Studies (STS)</a> like me you quickly learn how different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_(social_sciences)">framings</a> around technology shape the way it is perceived, adopted, rejected or regulated. And how important it is to question those framings, to open them for plural scrutiny:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Real change will come not when we turn away from technology toward meaning, but when we recognize the nature of our subordinate position in the technical systems that enroll us, and begin to intervene in the design process in the defense of the conditions of a meaningful life and a livable environment.</p>

<p>Related to Feenberg‚Äôs ideas, last weekend I was reading this <a href="https://estsjournal.org/index.php/ests/issue/view/13">thematic collection</a> in <em><a href="https://estsjournal.org">Engaging Science, Technology, and Society</a></em> journal. The collection addresses different aspects of the relationship between STS and democracy. I was particularly interested in an essay by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lynch_(ethnomethodologist)">Michael Lynch</a>, on the role of questioning science and technology in an era of post-truth and anti-science movements. I don‚Äôt want to spoil it, but maybe you can get a hint by its title <em>‚ÄúWe Have Never Been Anti-Science: Reflections on Science Wars and Post-Truth‚Äù</em>.</p>

<p>That was <strong>quite</strong> a long introduction just to bring up that I finally published a reduced <a href="https://thessaly.github.io/gosh-history">history</a> of the <a href="https://openhardware.science">Global Open Science Hardware (GOSH) movement</a> for <a href="https://forum.openhardware.science/t/gosh-history-open-to-comments">community review</a>.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a reduced version as it‚Äôs supposed to give lots of info in a quick glance for those visiting GOSH website. A longer version is included in a chapter of my thesis that analyzes GOSH as a <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Grassroots-Innovation-Movements-1st-Edition/Smith-Fressoli-Abrol-Arond-Ely/p/book/9781138901223">Grassroots Innovation Movement</a>. I‚Äôll also publish an article on it, but I have to decide in which journal (I‚Äôm between going for the <a href="https://openhardware.metajnl.com/">Journal of Open Hardware</a> or something more STS-related), if it gets accepted.</p>

<p>I originally aimed to render the text with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporwave">vaporwave</a>, retro-internet aesthetic (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfbQ5mHWkOs">this M.I.A. video</a> for reference, in case you‚Äôre <strong>too</strong> young). But afterwards I thought it wouldn‚Äôt match GOSH website‚Äôs look &amp; feel, it wouldn‚Äôt look ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù. So I became all boring and fell for a standard Bootstrap CSS. On the bright side, I finally mastered <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox">CSS flexbox</a> and embedding multimedia while keeping it <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_Mode">responsive</a> (yay!).</p>
