So, welcome to my blog! It's called *hyphae*. Which is the plural of *hypha*, and according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha) is:

> a long, branching filamentous structure of a fungus, oomycete, or actinobacterium.

and also:

>in most fungi are the main mode of vegetative growth, and are collectively called a mycelium.

Besides thinking fungi look extremely cool (see below), I like the fact that hyphae grow at their tips, kind of building on top of whatever is already there, elongating further.

Moreover, the symbiotic association of fungi with some tress/plants, or [mycorrhiza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhiza) it's something that blew my mind when I learned about it during [undergrad](https://www.agro.uba.ar/carreras/ambientales). It allows not only the exchange of sugar compounds (or food for fungi) in return for minerals that plants need; it's also a whole communications network<sup>1</sup>. Trees use it to signal stress to their neighbours<sup>2</sup>, including alerts if a predator is nearby (so they can prepare their defenses)<sup>3</sup>, and of course for transferring resources between them.

*Those are enough reasons for hyphae to deserve -at least- a blog.*


## What to expect from this blog
I expect this blog will have almost none (in the best case, very little) of plant phisiology content, sorry for that.

Hyphae will host some of the things I'm doing *on the sides* of my life as a PhD-student-who-also-has-many-side-projects. These are probably the things I enjoy the most, and keep me surviving through [the thesis](github.com/thessaly/phd) process.

Some topics that may appear as I learn along the way:

- open hardware, some small experiments and also some reflections,
- wikidata & python experiments,
- ideas on feminism, particularly in the "open" technology spaces,
- ideas on community organizing, cooperativism and changing the world,
- ideas on agroecological ways of producing food (related to item above), 
- posts in English and Spanish (as much as I can)

It is, of course, an ever-growing list. As hyphae, these are work and ideas which grow at the tips, slowly, elongating a bit each time. Underneath the surface (in my head) they're exchanging material and information, and at some point I expect they connect to each other.
